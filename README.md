# Interview-Grader
Lockeed Martin Interview Grader
The Interview Grader - INDUSTRY SPONSORED
The Interview Grader is a real-time system designed to help recruiters and hiring managers evaluate job candidates by providing objective and data-driven feedback on their non-verbal communication, specifically their pose and emotional expressions. The system will utilize computer vision techniques for pose estimation and emotion recognition, enabling it to analyze the candidate's body language and facial expressions during the virtual interview.

The system will consist of two main components:

Pose Estimation: The system will use a deep learning-based model to estimate the candidate's pose in real-time, providing feedback on their posture, gestures, and overall body language. The system can identify nervous habits, confidence levels, and engagement, which can be used to assess the candidate's communication skills and overall fit for the position.

Emotion Recognition: The system will also use a deep learning-based model to recognize the candidate's emotional expressions during the interview. By analyzing facial expressions, the system can provide feedback on the candidate's emotional state, helping recruiters and hiring managers to gauge the candidate's enthusiasm, motivation, and cultural fit.

The Interview Grader will be designed as a user-friendly application, allowing recruiters and hiring managers to evaluate candidates in a consistent and objective manner. The system will provide real-time feedback and scores, helping recruiters and hiring managers to make informed decisions about which candidates to move forward in the hiring process.

Deliverables:
A functional prototype of the Interview Grader application.
A technical report detailing the system architecture, algorithms, and techniques used.
A user manual and guidelines for using the Interview Grader.
A presentation summarizing the project's goals, methods, and results.
